# census
 
This repo contains the main ipython notebook, showing how to pull data from the census website (https://www.census.gov/developers/), insert the data into several postgresSQL tables and query the top 10 most improvished zipcodes

Despite the Census API error, as it did not sent over registration email, I was still able to pull the data since the you are not required for a key if making less than 50 calls/day

The main codes are displayed in the **main_notebook.ipynb** jupyter notebook
